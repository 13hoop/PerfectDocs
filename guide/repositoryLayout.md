# Repository Layout
The Perfect framework has been divided into several repositories to make it easy for you to find, download, and install the components you need for your project:

* [Perfect](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect) - This repository contains the core PerfectLib and will continue to be the main landing point for the project
* [PerfectTemplate](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/PerfectTemplate) - A simple starter project which compiles with the Swift Package Manager into a standalone executable HTTP server. This repository is ideal for starting on your own Perfect-based project
* [PerfectDocs](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/PerfectDocs) - Contains all API reference-related material
* [PerfectExamples](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/PerfectExamples) - All the Perfect example projects and documentation
* [Perfect-Redis](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-Redis) - Redis database connector
* [Perfect-SQLite](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-SQLite) - SQLite3 database connector
* [Perfect-PostgreSQL](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-PostgreSQL) - PostgreSQL database connector
* [Perfect-MySQL](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-MySQL) - MySQL database connector
* [Perfect-MongoDB](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-MongoDB) - MongoDB database connector
* [Perfect-FastCGI-Apache2.4](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-FastCGI-Apache2.4) - Apache 2.4 FastCGI module; required for the Perfect FastCGI server variant

All of the database connectors are standalone, and they can be used for other projects outside of the Perfect framework.
